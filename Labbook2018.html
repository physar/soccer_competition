<h2>July 7, 2018</h2>

<li>Made <a href=https://github.com/physar/soccer_competition>a repository</a>.
<li>Downloaded <a href=https://help.eclipse.org/photon/index.jsp>Eclipse Photon</a> plus <a href=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>Oracle JDK 1.8.0</a> (update 171). Only installed java-photon.
<li>Design would be to read in a list of soccerclubs (three is enough for initial testing): <tt>eredivisie.txt</tt>
<li>Saving the Eclipse project in my git directory of my Ubuntu home didn't work. Nothing is visible to bash.
<li>Used the Refract command to move the Java project to a Windows directory.
<li>Followed <a href=http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html#installation-of-git-support-into-eclipse>this instructions</a> to install the eGit plugin. The eGit plugin was already installed (part of the Java version), so this was only an update.
<li>Commit my first version (with CTRL+#).
